# Data type in JavaScript

- The data types in JavaScript divided into primitives and objects.
- The primitives are immutable, that is, they don't change over time.
- The  existing data types are:

| Example | Return |
| -------------------- | --------------------- |
| typeof 10 | number |
| typeof “test” | string |
| typeof true | boolean |
| typeof Symbol('iterator') | symbol |
| typeof null | object |
| typeof undefined | undefined |

- Objects are values that represent an in-memory reference that can be changed.
- typeof is diferent from instanceof.
